## Data Migration Considerations

### Old Bills (Created before GST support)
- `subtotal`: null/undefined ‚Üí Calculate from lineItems
- `taxPercentage`: null/undefined ‚Üí Default to 0 or tenant's current rate
- `taxAmount`: null/undefined ‚Üí Calculate as 0
- `totalAmount`: null/undefined ‚Üí Calculate from lineItems sum

### Payment Details Migration
- Old bills may have payment details on Client record (issuedBy)
- New system: Payment details stored on Tenant record
- **Solution**: Use effectiveIssuerData fallback pattern

## Testing Checklist

### Old Bills
- [ ] Test bill created before GST support displays correctly

- [ ] Test PDF generation for old bills

### New Bills

### Payment Details

## Backend Endpoints

### Queries
- `bills` - Get all bills (includes GST fields)
- `bill(id)` - Get single bill (includes GST fields)
- `getBillIssuerDetails(billId)` - Get issuer's payment details
- `currentTenant` - Get tenant company & payment details

### Mutations
- `createBill(input)` - Auto-calculates GST from tenant's taxPercentage
- `updateBill(id, input)` - Update bill details
- `updateTenantCompanyDetails(companyDetails)` - Update company info & tax rate
- `updateTenantPaymentDetails(paymentDetails)` - Update payment receiving details

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/business-builder-backend/src/entities/models/Bill.ts` - Added GST fields
- `/business-builder-backend/src/entities/models/Client.ts` - Removed strict validation decorators
- `/business-builder-backend/src/entities/models/Tenant.ts` - Added company details & payment details
- `/business-builder-backend/src/resolvers/bill.resolver.ts` - GST calculation logic, `getBillIssuerDetails` now uses tenant data
- `/business-builder-backend/src/resolvers/tenant.resolver.ts` - Company/payment mutations

### Frontend
- `/src/pages/bills/BillDetails.tsx` - GST breakdown display, tenant fallback
- `/src/pages/bills/Bills.tsx` - GST in list view
- `/src/pages/bills/NewBill.tsx` - GST calculation, optional projectId, client selector, payment method toggles
- `/src/pages/bills/CompanyDetails.tsx` - Tax percentage, invoice preferences

## Notes

- All GST fields are nullable for backward compatibility
- Frontend includes fallback logic: `bill.totalAmount ?? calculate from lineItems`
- **IMPORTANT: Tenant payment/company details take precedence over client details**
- Tax percentage stored with each bill for historical accuracy
- `getBillIssuerDetails` resolver now returns TENANT data for business name, tax ID, and payment details
- Client data only used for issuer's personal contact info (name, email, phone)
