## IT Services & Infrastructure
**Managed IT Support Provider Evaluation**

### Current Pain Points & Why We Need Change

#### Critical Issues with Current Provider (Chris)
1. **No 24/7 On-Demand Support**
   - Current provider is not available 24/7
   - Unresponsive when staff need immediate assistance
   - Critical for aged care facility operating round the clock
   - Staff unable to access systems when urgent support needed

2. **Lack of Transparency & Management Systems**
   - No professional ticketing system in place
   - CTO has no visibility into IT issues and resolutions
   - No audit trail of problems and fixes
   - Unable to track recurring issues or patterns
   - No service level agreements or response time guarantees

3. **Security & Email Management Risks**
   - Currently using shared email accounts - major security risk
   - Example: nurses@paradiselakescarecentre.com.au shared by multiple staff
   - No individual accountability - cannot track who sent what
   - No proper security groups configuration
   - Lack of audit trail for communications
   - Non-compliance with best practices for data protection
   - If one person leaves, everyone's password must be changed
   - Higher risk of data breaches with shared credentials

4. **Outdated Infrastructure**
   - Still on ADSL copper connection - inadequate for facility size
   - Cannot support multiple VoIP or video calls simultaneously
   - Bottleneck when staff and clients need concurrent connectivity
   - Inconsistent Wi-Fi coverage throughout facility
   - Dead zones affecting staff productivity and client services
   - No redundancy or failover options

5. **Windows 10 End-of-Life Crisis**
   - All computers currently running Windows 10
   - Windows 11 upgrade required by October/November 2025 to access SureCare
   - SureCare uses Microsoft Access - requires Windows 11 compatibility
   - Hardware may not support Windows 11 upgrade requirements
   - Alternative: Move to web-based or server-based clinical notes system
   - Would eliminate desktop environment complexity and upgrade cycles

6. **Cost Inefficiencies**
   - Paying $20/month for full email licenses when not needed
   - Most staff are casual workers who still need email access
   - Basic email licenses at $4/month would suffice for casual staff
   - Casual staff don't need full Office suite - just email functionality
   - Potential significant cost savings with proper license management
   - Example: 30 casual staff x $16 savings = $480/month saved
   - No economies of scale with current setup

### Requirements for New Managed IT Provider
- 24/7 technical support availability
- Professional ticketing system with full transparency
- Proper email and security management
- Individual email accounts for all staff
- Cost-effective licensing structure
- On-site support when required
- Proactive monitoring and maintenance
- Clear SLAs and response times
