# Investment-Ready Business Features

## Why "Investment Ready" Matters for One Group

When investors or acquirers evaluate a solar business, they look for:
1. **Clean, auditable data** - Can they trust the numbers?
2. **Automated processes** - Does the business run without the founder?
3. **Growth metrics** - Is there a clear trajectory?
4. **Customer insights** - Do you know your unit economics?
5. **Scalable systems** - Can this business 10x?

Your website becomes the **data foundation** for investment readiness.

Say:
> "Every month, we build features that make your business more attractive to investors or acquirers. Think of it like preparing for due diligence from day one. We track the metrics that matter: Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, Monthly Recurring Revenue, gross margins by project type, and referral rates. When it's time to raise capital or exit, you'll have years of clean data ready to go."

## Monthly Feature Request Examples (For Proposal)

In the agreement, update the "Monthly Feature Development" section with concrete examples:

**Example Monthly Features:**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tracker by marketing channel
- Lifetime Value (CLV) calculator with upsell tracking
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) dashboard for maintenance contracts
- Gross margin analysis by project type (residential/commercial)
- Sales pipeline conversion funnel with drop-off analysis

- Referral rate tracking and viral coefficient calculation
- Employee productivity metrics (revenue per installer)
- Lead source attribution and ROI dashboard
- Customer satisfaction score tracking
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) automation

**The Key Message:**
> Each month, you choose one feature from this list (or suggest your own). Over 12 months, you build an investor-ready business intelligence system that positions One Group for acquisition or capital raise.

---

## Why This Messaging Wins

1. **Positions you as strategic advisor**, not just web developer
2. **Speaks the language of business owners thinking about exits**
3. **Differentiates from WordPress/Webflow** (they can't do this)
4. **Justifies the $497/month** (you're building enterprise BI tools)
5. **Makes the monthly feature tangible** (not vague "enhancements")
6. **Shows you understand their business**, not just tech

---

## Implementation in Agreement

```
