*Unified Digital Platform for Solar, Finance & Property Investment*

**SCRIPT:**
"Hey team, I'm Tom from Tom Miller Services. I've put together a comprehensive proposal for your new website that goes way beyond what you'd get from WordPress or Webflow. This is about creating a unified digital presence across all three of your verticals - Solar, Finance, and Property Investment - so you can capitalize on the compounding effect of your integrated business model. Let me walk you through exactly what you're getting and why this is the right move for One Group."

## SLIDE 2: The Solution Overview

## SLIDE 4: Unified Dashboard - Your CRM Data in One Place
**One Dashboard to Manage Them All:**
- Aggregates GoHighLevel + Pipedrive data in a single unified view
- Track customers across all three verticals
- Bird's eye calendar for scheduling and automation
- Foundation for your own automation layer
- What WordPress & Webflow can't do - but what makes a business investment-ready

**SCRIPT:**
"Here's what sets this apart from WordPress or Webflow: you're getting a unified dashboard that aggregates both your GoHighLevel AND Pipedrive data in one single view. This means you can see your entire customer journey across all three divisions - Solar, Finance, and Property - without switching between platforms. You get a bird's eye calendar for scheduling and automation across all verticals. This isn't just about managing contacts - it's about laying the foundation for your own automation layer. When you're ready to show investors your business, you'll have a unified data room that's always up-to-date, showing the compounding effect of your three-vertical strategy. This is what makes a business investment-ready - and it's what template platforms simply can't deliver."

## SLIDE 5: Scheduling & Forecasting - Built on Your Unified Dashboard
**Everything Scheduled from a Bird's Eye View:**
- Campaign planning across all three divisions
- Installation scheduling (Solar division)
- Property inspection scheduling (Property division)
- Finance consultation booking (Finance division)
- SMS & email broadcast scheduling across verticals
- Powerful forecasting and capacity planning

**SCRIPT:**
"Because we're building this unified dashboard that manages both GoHighLevel and Pipedrive, we're also laying the foundation for powerful scheduling and forecasting. Imagine scheduling solar installations, property inspections, and finance consultations all from one bird's eye calendar view. Map out cross-vertical marketing campaigns - send a solar campaign, then automatically follow up with property investment offers. Book installation crews, plan email sequences, schedule SMS blasts - all visible in one unified calendar. This foundation allows you to forecast capacity, predict revenue across divisions, and plan resource allocation from a single management interface. This is unified operations built for scale."

## SLIDE 6: Content & SEO Control
**Train Your Team:**
- Browser-based content editor
- Edit any page without developer
- SEO metadata management on every page
- Training for 2 team members included

**SCRIPT:**
"This is huge: I'm including a browser-based editor that lets your marketing team change ANY page content themselves. Want to update a headline? Change a photo? Adjust pricing? Your team does it in minutes, not waiting days for a developer. Plus, every single page has SEO controls built-in. Your team can optimize meta descriptions, titles, and keywords on the fly."

---

## SLIDE 7: Blockchain & AI Ready
**Future-Proofing Your Business:**
- Smart contract integration capability
- AI-friendly data structure
- Automated business processes beyond CRM
- Transaction automation with blockchain

**SCRIPT:**
"Here's where this gets interesting. As AI and automation mature, they need blockchain to handle transactions and value exchange. I'm building your site to integrate with blockchain smart contracts from day one. This means you can automate things like: deposit payments when a contract is signed, milestone payments when installation is verified, referral commissions automatically paid out. This level of automation isn't possible in WordPress, Webflow, or even your current CRM platforms."

## SLIDE 8: The Investment
**ONE-TIME BUILD: $16,797**
- 80 custom pages
- 11 financial calculators
- CRM integrations (Pipedrive + Go High Level)

- $2,000 - Launch & Team Training

**SCRIPT:**
"The one-time build investment is $16,797, broken into 5 clear milestones. You only pay as we hit each milestone, so you see progress before every payment. This is less than you'd spend getting similar functionality from WordPress or Webflow, and you get full ownership."

## SLIDE 9: Ongoing Managed Services - $497/Month
**Included Every Month:**
- 1 new investment-ready feature across any vertical (~4 hours work)
- Complete hosting & infrastructure for all divisions
- Managed MongoDB database
- Security updates & monitoring
- Technical support for all three divisions
- 2 content editor licenses (manage all verticals)

**SCRIPT:**
"The ongoing managed services is $497 per month for the entire One Group platform. That includes hosting, security, backups, support - all the infrastructure for all three divisions. But more importantly, every month you get one new investment-ready feature. Track cross-vertical customer lifetime value? Build a dashboard showing which vertical drives the most referrals? Add property management metrics? It's all included. These are features that make One Group more attractive to investors by demonstrating your unique compounding business model. It's like having a developer on retainer who understands your integrated strategy."

## SLIDE 10: Why Not WordPress or Webflow?
**Comparison:**
- **WordPress/Webflow:** Templates, plugin dependencies, security risks, NO unified dashboard capability, limited customization
- **This Solution:** Custom-built, unified GoHighLevel + Pipedrive dashboard, investment-ready data room, blockchain-ready, AI-ready, no plugin bloat

**Total Value: $28,500+**

**SCRIPT:**
"You could go with WordPress or Webflow, but here's what you'd be missing: the unified dashboard. Those platforms simply cannot aggregate your GoHighLevel and Pipedrive data into one management view. They can't give you that bird's eye calendar for cross-vertical scheduling and automation. You'd be stuck switching between multiple platforms, and when investors ask to see your data room, you'd spend 6 months preparing it manually. With this solution, your investment-ready data room is built in real-time. This is the difference between a template website and a platform that makes your business attractive to investors and acquirers."

## SLIDE 12: The One Group Advantage
**Why This Is Perfect for Your 3-Vertical Strategy:**
- Unified dashboard aggregating GoHighLevel + Pipedrive (what makes you investment-ready)
- Calculators capture high-intent leads across all divisions and enable cross-selling

- Track which vertical drives the most referrals to other divisions

**SCRIPT:**
"This solution is built specifically for integrated business groups like One Group. This isn't about managing three separate websites - it's about creating one unified platform with a dashboard that aggregates all your CRM data from GoHighLevel and Pipedrive. When a customer comes in through solar, the unified dashboard tracks their journey to finance and property - all in one view. You can show investors from your bird's eye calendar: 'Here's our CAC by division, here's our cross-vertical customer lifetime value, here's how many solar customers become property investors.' That's the story that commands premium valuations. This platform makes that story visible, quantifiable, and always up-to-date. It's your investment-ready data room, built in real-time."

- What if we need more than one feature per month?

**SCRIPT:**
"I know you'll have questions. How does data migration work? Can we adjust calculators later? What if you want to cancel? How fast can we launch? What if you need more than one feature some months? I've got answers for all of this. Let's jump on a call, or just shoot me questions via email. I want you to feel 100% confident this is the right move."
