## What Your Final Deck Should Look Like

**Slide 1:** Dark background, large white title, blue accent underline
**Slide 2-14:** Consistent layout, bullet points with icons, readable from distance
**Slide 15:** Strong CTA with your email prominent

**Overall feel:**
- Modern tech company (think Apple keynote)
- Dark, sleek, professional
- Not too busy - lots of whitespace
- Blue accent pops against dark background
- Easy to read on screen recording

## Recording the Video

Once you have slides:

1. **Use Loom or OBS** to screen record
2. **Picture-in-picture** - Your face in bottom right corner
3. **Walk through slides** while narrating from script
4. **Switch to browser** for live demos (calendar, editor, etc.)
5. **End on slide 15** (the CTA slide)
6. **Keep it 8-10 minutes** - Gamma will help you stay on track
