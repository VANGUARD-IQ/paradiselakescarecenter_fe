## SERVICES PROVIDED

### Monthly Feature Development
We'll develop and deploy **one (1) investment-ready feature per month** to make One Group more attractive to investors and acquirers across all three verticals.

**The Foundation: Unified Dashboard**
We build you a unified dashboard that aggregates GoHighLevel + Pipedrive data into one management view with bird's eye calendar for scheduling and automation. This is what WordPress and Webflow can't do - combine metrics from multiple platforms into one investment-ready data room.

Part of your monthly service includes managing the microservices that make daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots possible - keeping your data room always up-to-date for investors.

**Then We Add Investment-Ready Features Monthly:**
- **Cross-Vertical Analytics:** Track which vertical generates the most qualified leads and cross-sell opportunities
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tracking by marketing channel and division
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) across all three verticals (compound customer value)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) dashboard for maintenance contracts and property management
- Gross margin analysis by vertical (Solar vs Finance vs Property)
- Sales pipeline conversion analytics and cross-vertical funnel visualization
- Referral rate tracking showing the compounding effect between divisions
- Lead source attribution showing cross-vertical lead flow
- Employee productivity dashboards (revenue per division, per team member)
- Due diligence data export tools for investors (showing diversified revenue streams)
- **Vertical Integration Metrics:** Track customers who engage with 2+ divisions

**Also Includes Standard Enhancements:**
- Site tweaks and design improvements across all divisions
- New functionality within existing pages
- Small integrations or updates
- Content structure modifications

**What Qualifies:**
Features that provide business intelligence, track key performance indicators (KPIs), or prepare One Group for investment, acquisition, or scale. Each feature is scoped to approximately 4 hours of implementation time.

**Why This Matters for One Group:**
When you're ready to raise capital, bring in investors, or exit the business, you'll have years of clean, auditable data that demonstrates the compounding effect of your three-vertical strategy. The unified dashboard gives you what WordPress and Webflow can't: a single view of all your CRM data (GoHighLevel + Pipedrive) with bird's eye scheduling and automation capabilities. This is what makes a business investment-ready. Investors will see how Solar customers become Finance clients who then invest in Property - this is the data room that typically takes 6 months to prepare. You'll have it built in real-time, showing the unique value of your integrated business model.
