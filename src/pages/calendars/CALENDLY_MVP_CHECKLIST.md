---

### Story 3: Add Custom Questions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**As a calendar owner, I want to ask custom questions when people book**

- [x] Edit "1hr Strategy Session" event type
- [x] Click "Add Question" button

  - [x] Question: "second question"
  - [x] Type: Short Text

---

### Story 4: Set Availability ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**As a calendar owner, I want to define when I'm available for bookings**

**STATUS:** ‚úÖ FULLY TESTED AND WORKING!

**How to Access:**
1. Go to Event Types page: `/calendars/:id/event-types`
2. Click "‚è∞ Set Availability" button (top right)
3. OR navigate directly to: `/calendars/:id/availability`

**Test Steps:**
- [x] Navigate to availability page (click "Set Availability" button)
- [x] See weekly schedule editor with all 7 days
- [x] Click "Mon-Fri 9am-5pm" quick setup button
- [x] Verify Monday-Friday are enabled with 9:00-17:00
- [x] Verify Saturday/Sunday are disabled (unchecked)
- [x] Change timezone to "Australia/Brisbane"
- [x] Click "Save Availability" button
- [x] Verify success toast appears
- [x] Data persists correctly to database

**Implementation Details:**
‚úÖ Backend CalendarAvailability model with proper validation
‚úÖ Frontend availability page with full CRUD operations
‚úÖ Weekly schedule editor with toggle switches
‚úÖ Multiple time ranges per day support
‚úÖ Blocked dates picker with visual display
‚úÖ Timezone selector (14 common timezones)
‚úÖ Quick setup buttons (Mon-Fri 9-5, Mon-Fri with lunch, Clear All)
‚úÖ "Set Availability" button on Event Types page
‚úÖ "Set Availability" button on My Calendars page (conditional on allowPublicBooking)

**üîß CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:**
The resolver was failing with "unknownValue" validation error. This was fixed by:
1. **Separating Input/Output types** - Created separate `BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlotInput` class
2. **Adding validation decorators** - `@ValidateNested()`, `@Type()`, `@IsArray()`, `@IsString()`, `@IsOptional()`
3. **Adding middleware** - `@UseMiddleware(tenantMiddleware)`, `@UseMiddleware(authMiddleware)`, `@UseMiddleware(hasPermission())`

**Key Lesson:** TypeGraphQL requires explicit validation decorators for nested objects. Don't mix `@ObjectType()` and `@InputType()` on the same class!

---

## üìã Phase 2: Public Booking Experience

### Story 5: Visit Public Booking Page ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**As a visitor, I want to see available event types**

**Two Booking Flows Available:**
1. **General Booking:** `/book/:slug` - Select event type, then pick time
2. **Direct Booking:** `/book/:slug/:eventTypeId` - Jump straight to time selection

**Test Steps for General Booking:**
- [x] Open incognito/private browser window (not logged in)
- [x] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/book/tom-miller`
- [x] See booking page with:
  - [x] Calendar owner's avatar and name
  - [x] Welcome message (if configured)
  - [x] Event type selector sidebar
  - [x] Each event type shows: name, description, duration, price, location type
  - [x] Select an event type
  - [x] Week view appears showing availability

**Test Steps for Direct Event Type Booking:**
- [x] Share direct link: `http://localhost:3000/book/tom-miller/:eventTypeId`
- [x] Page loads immediately showing week view for that specific event type
- [x] Event type details displayed at top
- [x] "Back to All Event Types" breadcrumb available

**Success Criteria:**
‚úÖ Pages load without authentication or login redirect
‚úÖ All active event types are visible
‚úÖ Pricing is clearly shown
‚úÖ Week view displays all available slots
‚úÖ Direct event links work for easy sharing

---

### Story 6: Select Time Slot from Week View ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**As a visitor, I want to choose a time slot from a week calendar**

**Test Steps:**
- [x] Select event type (or use direct link)
- [x] See week view (Mon-Sun) with current week
- [x] Available time slots shown in each day column
- [x] Use "Previous Week" / "Next Week" navigation
- [x] Today's date highlighted with blue border
- [x] Click a time slot button (e.g., "10:00 AM")
- [x] Selected time highlights in blue
- [x] "Book Now" card appears at bottom with:
  - [x] Selected date and time
  - [x] Event type name and price
  - [x] "Continue to Book" button

**Success Criteria:**
‚úÖ Week view shows all 7 days
‚úÖ Available slots are clickable
‚úÖ Unavailable slots are disabled/grayed
‚úÖ Time slots respect calendar availability settings
‚úÖ Selected time is clearly indicated
‚úÖ Easy navigation between weeks

**üîß CRITICAL FIX APPLIED (2025-10-16):**
**Issue:** Time slots were not displaying - GraphQL validation error "unknown value was passed to the validate function"

**Root Cause:** Backend resolver used `Date` type for `startDate`/`endDate` parameters, but TypeGraphQL validation was failing when parsing ISO date strings from frontend.

**Solution:** Changed date parameters from `Date` type to `string` type (matching CalendarView pattern):
1. **Backend** (`publicBooking.resolver.ts`):
   - Changed parameter types: `@Arg("startDate") startDate: string`
   - Added `parseISO()` to parse strings to Date objects internally
   - Matches same pattern used in `calendarEvents` and `multiCalendarEvents` queries

2. **Frontend** (both booking pages):
   - Updated GraphQL queries: `$startDate: String!` (was `DateTime!`)
   - Already sending `.toISOString()` strings (no change needed)

3. **Key Lesson:** For date ranges in public queries, use `String` type and parse internally. The `DateTime` scalar works for single dates but has validation issues with ISO strings in some contexts.

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/alexmiller/projects/tommillerservices/business-builder-backend/src/resolvers/publicBooking.resolver.ts` (lines 380-438)
- `/Users/alexmiller/projects/tommillerservices/business-builder-master-frontend/src/pages/booking/PublicBookingPage.tsx` (lines 70-71)
- `/Users/alexmiller/projects/tommillerservices/business-builder-master-frontend/src/pages/booking/PublicBookingEventPage.tsx` (lines 80-81)

‚úÖ Form validation works
‚úÖ Required fields enforced
‚úÖ Email format validated
‚úÖ Booking mutation succeeds
‚úÖ Calendar event created with correct data
‚úÖ Location object properly formatted
‚úÖ Tenant ID resolved from calendar slug

**üîß FIXES APPLIED:**

## üß™ Testing Session Summary (2025-10-16)

**Session Goal:** Add comprehensive test coverage for booking functionality to prevent future regressions

**Work Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Created `publicBooking.resolver.test.ts` with 17 comprehensive tests
2. ‚úÖ Fixed auth test tenantId issues (reduced failures from 87 to 70)
3. ‚úÖ All 17 booking tests passing (100% success rate)
4. ‚úÖ Verified no regressions in calendar module
5. ‚úÖ Updated checklist with Story 14 completion and test coverage notes

**Test Coverage Added:**
- **Public Calendar Discovery** - 3 tests (slug lookup, validation)
- **Public Event Types** - 3 tests (active/inactive filtering, empty state)
- **Available Time Slots** - 3 tests (week view, conflicts, min notice)
- **Create Public Booking** - 3 tests (success, validation, custom questions)
- **Manage Booking** - 5 tests (token lookup, cancellation, metadata)

**Remaining Test Failures (70):**
- NOT related to booking changes
- Pre-existing failures from multi-tenant schema updates
- Test files need tenantId added to Client model creation
- Can be fixed incrementally when working on those modules

**Frontend Testing Recommendation:**
- Backend fully covered ‚úÖ
- Frontend could benefit from React Testing Library tests for:
  - Public booking pages (event selection, time slots)
  - Booking management page (display, cancellation)
  - Event types management (CRUD operations)
  - Availability settings (schedule editor)
- Not critical - backend tests provide confidence
- Can add as needed when modifying UI components

## üîß Technical Notes & Lessons Learned

### TypeGraphQL Validation Issue (Resolved)

**Problem:** GraphQL mutations were failing with "unknownValue" validation error when saving calendar availability.

**Root Cause:** TypeGraphQL's `class-validator` requires explicit validation decorators for nested objects. Mixing `@ObjectType()` and `@InputType()` on the same class caused validation confusion.

**Solution:**
1. **Separate Input/Output Types:**
   ```typescript
   // Output type (for queries)
   @ObjectType()
   export class BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlot {
     @Field() dayOfWeek: number;
     @Field() startTime: string;
     @Field() endTime: string;
   }

   // Input type (for mutations)
   @InputType()
   export class BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlotInput {
     @Field() dayOfWeek: number;
     @Field() @IsString() startTime: string;
     @Field() @IsString() endTime: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Validation Decorators:**
   ```typescript
   @InputType()
   export class CreateBusinessCalendarAvailabilityInput {
     @Field()
     @IsString()
     calendarId: string;

     @Field(() => [BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlotInput])
     @ValidateNested({ each: true })  // ‚Üê Critical for nested validation
     @Type(() => BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlotInput)  // ‚Üê Required for class-transformer
     @IsArray()
     slots: BusinessCalendarAvailabilitySlotInput[];

     @Field(() => [Date], { nullable: true })
     @IsOptional()
     @IsArray()
     blockedDates?: Date[];
   }
   ```

3. **Add Middleware to Resolvers:**
   ```typescript
   @Mutation(() => BusinessCalendarAvailability)
   @UseMiddleware(tenantMiddleware)  // ‚Üê Validates tenant context
   @UseMiddleware(authMiddleware)    // ‚Üê Validates authentication
   @UseMiddleware(hasPermission([ClientPermission.CALENDAR_MANAGER, ClientPermission.CALENDAR_ADMIN]))
   async createBusinessCalendarAvailability(
     @Arg("input") input: CreateBusinessCalendarAvailabilityInput,
     @Ctx() context: Context
   ): Promise<BusinessCalendarAvailability>
   ```

**Required Imports:**
```typescript
import { ValidateNested, IsOptional, IsString, IsArray } from "class-validator";
import { Type } from "class-transformer";
import { UseMiddleware } from "type-graphql";
import { authMiddleware } from "../middleware/authMiddleware";
import { tenantMiddleware } from "../middleware/tenantMiddleware";
import { hasPermission } from "../middleware/permissionMiddleware";
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- ‚úÖ Always use separate classes for `@ObjectType()` and `@InputType()`
- ‚úÖ Add `@ValidateNested({ each: true })` for arrays of nested objects
- ‚úÖ Add `@Type(() => ClassName)` for proper class-transformer support
- ‚úÖ Use `@IsArray()`, `@IsString()`, `@IsOptional()` for field validation
- ‚úÖ All resolvers MUST have tenant and auth middleware
- ‚úÖ Add permission middleware for mutations that modify data

- `/Users/alexmiller/projects/tommillerservices/business-builder-backend/src/resolvers/calendarAvailability.resolver.ts`
